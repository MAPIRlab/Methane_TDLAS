# VmbNET

The .NET API of the [Vimba X SDK](https://www.alliedvision.com).

Vimba X is a fully GenICam compliant SDK and the successor of Vimba. VmbNET is the .NET API that is
provided by this SDK. It provides access to the full functionality of Vimba X from .NET applications.

VmbNET can be used on Windows64, Linux64 and Linux ARM.

# Installation

To use VmbNET, a .NET runtime providing .NET Standard 2.0 is required.
These are .NET Framework 4.6.2 or above and .NET Core 2.0 or above.
A ready-to-install nuget package
for VmbNET (whose file name ends with `.nupkg`) that conforms to .NET Standard 2.0
can be found as part of the Vimba X installation.
This nuget package can be installed in an application in various ways.

## 1. Installation with Visual Studio 2019 (Windows64 only)

After opening your application's project file with Visual Studio 2019,
1. Open the NuGet Package Manager for the project by right-clicking it in Solution Explorer
and selecting `Manage NuGet Packages...`.
2. Click the cog wheel after `Package source:` to open the 
package sources, and add the full path to the directory containing the `.nupkg` file
by clicking the `+` icon and entering this path into the `Source:` field.
The `Name:` field can be whatever you like, but you will need it just now.
Close this window to return to the NuGet Package Manager.
3. Open the drop-down menu after `Package source:` and either select `All` or the `Name:` field value you used
when adding the package source for VmbNET.
4. Select the "Browse" tab and search for `VmbNET`.
Clik the VmbNET NuGet package that is displayed.
5. In the pane that appears, click `Install` to install the version shown.

## 2. Installation from the command line

* Add the full path to the directory containing the `.nupkg` file by executing

```C#
    dotnet nuget add source <path-to-directory-containing-VmbNET-NuGet-package> -n <user-chosen-name-for-this-package-source>
```

* Install VmbNET to your package by changing directory to the location of your project file and executing

```C#
    dotnet add package VmbNET
```

* Then build your application by changing directory to the location of your project file and executing

```C#
    dotnet build -c Release .
```

# Usage

Below is a minimal example demonstrating how to acquire frames for 2 seconds from the stream of the first camera found by VmbNET. It
highlights the general usage of VmbNET. More complete code examples can be found in the `Examples`
directory.

```C#
   using VmbNET;

   class Program
   {
       static void Main()
       {
           using var vmb = IVmbSystem.Startup(); // API startup (loads transport layers)

           var cam = vmb.GetCameras()[0]; // Get the first available camera

           using var openCam = cam.Open(); // Open the camera 

           openCam.Features.ExposureTime = 5000.0; // Set the exposure time value 

           // Register an event handler for incoming frames
           openCam.FrameReceived += (s,e) => 
           {
               using var frame = e.Frame;
               Console.WriteLine($"Frame Received! ID={frame.Id}");
           }; // IDisposable: Frame is automatically requeued

           // Convenience function to start acquisition
           using var acquisition = openCam.StartFrameAcquisition(); 

           Thread.Sleep(2000);

       } // IDisposable: Stops acquisition, closes camera, shuts down Vimba X
   }
```

# Versioning

To avoid manually looking after any versioning strings,
the version of the NuGet package as well as the various assembly versions
are created automatically during the build process from the last git tag,
excluding the release candidate information.
For example, if the git tag is "1.1.0_RC4", the version will be "1.1.0".
