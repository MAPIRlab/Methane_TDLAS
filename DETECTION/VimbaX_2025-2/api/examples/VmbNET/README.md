Compile instructions & tool chain requirements
----------------------------------------------

### Requirements

* .NET runtime version with which .NET Standard 2.0 is compatible (>= .NET Framework 4.6.1 or >= .NET Core 2)
* To use the Vimba X transport layers: Vimba X
* Editors:
  * Windows: Visual Studio >= 2019
  * Linux: Visual Studio Code
* Platforms: Windows 64-bit, Linux 64-bit or Linux ARM

### Compilation

Before building the examples, `user.build.props.TEMPLATE` must be renamed to `user.build.props`
and the text `place-runtime-identifier-here` in `user.build.props`
must be replaced with either `win-x64`, `linux-arm64` or `linux-x64`, depending on the desired platform.

Options such as the .NET runtime version or C# language version can be set in the *.csproj of the example that you want to use.

The examples can be built using Visual Studio (Windows only) or Visual Studio Code in the usual way.
Alternatively, use the `dotnet` command:
Open a command prompt in the directory of the example that you want to use and run

```console
dotnet build -c <configuration> .
```

where `<configuration>` is one of `Release` or `Debug`.
For example, to build a release version, run

```console
dotnet build -c Release
```
